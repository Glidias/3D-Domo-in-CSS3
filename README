His name is DOMO. I've made this experiment during my last research about using 3D & CSS3 in web browsers. It works on Google Chrome Canary & Safari (include mobile version for iOS).

Note: Move your mouse (or tap anywhere if you're using iOS) to change perspective angle. If you want to create army of little Domos - do so but remember about me.
